5. Export the function by name

Add appropriate unit tests in src/utils/__tests__/validation.test.ts following the existing test patterns.</message>

        <new_task>
        <mode>code</mode>
        <message>Implement the authentication API endpoints in src/api/auth.ts according to these specifications:

1. Create the following endpoints:
   - POST /api/auth/login: Accepts email/password, returns JWT token
   - POST /api/auth/register: Accepts user details, creates account
   - POST /api/auth/reset-password: Initiates password reset process
   - POST /api/auth/verify-reset-token: Validates reset token
   - POST /api/auth/change-password: Updates password with valid token

2. Follow these requirements:
   - Use the existing database models in src/models/User.ts
   - Apply the validation functions from src/utils/validation.ts
   - Implement JWT handling with the jsonwebtoken package
   - Add proper error handling using the ErrorHandler class
   - Follow the API response format defined in the project

3. Security considerations:
   - Hash passwords with bcrypt (10 rounds)
   - Generate secure random tokens for password reset
   - Set appropriate token expiration (30 minutes)
   - Implement rate limiting for auth endpoints

The authentication flow should integrate with the existing user management system and follow the architectural patterns defined in the project.</message>

          I need to proceed with the task without Memory Bank functionality.

            </read_file>
          - WAIT for confirmation.
      2. Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' and inform the user that the Memory Bank has been read and is now active.
      3. Proceed with orchestrating the task using the context from the Memory Bank.
